                My name is Kyle and I am studying to become a full stack developer. You are here because you want to learn a bit about me, right? I'll keep it short!
                <br><br>
                I love music, my two Huskies, and traveling the world with my family. I used to play guitar in a heavy metal band and got the opportunity to play at the Vans Warped Tour in San Francisco, CA! This is one of the most surreal and proud moment of my life to be able to perform in front of hundreds of people.
                My favorite travel spot is Paris, France. The architecture and the food are unparalleled and every time I go, I always want to stay!
                <br><br>
                I come from a background of Customer Service Management and Commodity Management. I have grown so much and have great lessons to take away from my experiences, but it is time for a new chapter in my life. It is my mission to be the best that I can be in the field of Web Development. I have so much passion, committment, and willingness to learn and I aim to show that wheverever my opportunity lies.
